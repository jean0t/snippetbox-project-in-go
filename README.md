# snippetbox-project-in-go


*Project made following the book "Let's Go" to learn about network apps in Golang*


to run the server with the contents, save the archives of the project through a git clone
```
git clone git@github.com:jean0t/snippetbox-project-in-go.git
```
or simply install the zip that git offers


After that,
go to the root directory (in this case *snippetbox-project-in-go*)
and use the command:
```go
go run ./cmd/web/*
```

it will run the webserver in your local host with the port `:4000` 
to access it go to your browser and use:
```
http://localhost:4000/
```
or shift localhost by `127.0.0.1` which ends up being the same
just one being from ipv4 pattern while the other is a name :)
